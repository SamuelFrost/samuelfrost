## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for visiting my github page. I'll be putting some links to my work/portfolio in the near future.

### What I'm working on:
- Organizing my projects into a neat portfolio. I'm using this as an opportunity to try out Polymer JS.
- A Ruby on Rails personal project for organizing events heavily utilizing the google calendar api.
- Finding a job doing software development.

### My professionally viable software skills:
I'm most comfortable with centering my projects around Ruby on Rails. I did full stack development with RoR for two jam packed years. As such, I'm pretty comfortable working around database management and understanding networking models as well as version control with git and working in both a waterfall and agile (scrum) team.

I am exploring other backend technologies like making microservices with Go.

Most of my front end development was vanilla js + goal specific libraries. So I haven't spent much time working with front end frameworks, but I've looked into them a lot recently and really love the idea of component centered web development. I've toyed around with making some vanilla JS web components and am now trying out Polymer JS. Additionally Progressive Web Applications have really caught my attention and are making me want to develop.

It's been a while, but I've also worked with PHP, Python, Pascal, C#.

### Proficient software skills keyword list:
Git, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, C#, Python, Pascal, Linux, AWS, EC2, DynamoDB, MySQL, SQL, PostgreSQL, Groonga, Vagrant (Virtual Machine Box management), Google SketchUp (CAD program), Unity, Polymer, Go

### About me (expanded):

I've been coding on and off since I was a child. When I first started it was just using scenario editors in StarCraft and WarCraft 3, my drive to make modifications to existing maps got me to look into how they were working by disecting the scenario logic and adding my own features from the techniques I learned. I gained an interest in Japanese and entrepreneurship and started working towards those. I entered community college at 15 to start taking Japanese. I went ahead and went homeschooled for highschool so I could focus on college courses at 16 which allowed me the freedom to go to Japan and solidify my Japanese skills at 17.

After coming back I decided to start my own business. I had been dabbling in making macros for an MMORPG called RuneScape. I decided to make some macros focused on making in game profits at exorbitant rates and selling the in game money at highly competitive market rates through acquaintances and introductions using some clever marketing. It went pretty well, albeit profits were quite insignificant. After a little over a year of this, I decided to shift my focus to University after being accepted to The University of Texas at Austin.

In the interest of having a relaxed college experience focused on socializing and graduating quickly to get into the job market due to family finances, I decided to major in Japanese and minor in business. I had a great 2.5 years there before graduating, but in the end I felt like I should've stretched it out to 4 years by double or triple majoring with Business and Computer Science.

After university I worked at a couple non programming positions including game support, baking, and doing some real estate investments/development with my brother. All the while I was dabbling in programming, experimenting with pyhton, ruby, and c# through Unity.

I felt things slowing down and wanted to force myself out of my comfort zone, so I decided to make the move to Japan and start looking for a software development position. After a couple months I found one at a smaller company. I started on a small project with php using the fuelphp framework and a lamp stack. I moved on to Ruby on Rails after 3 months and developed a larger application with RoR for two years while doing various company side projects on top of full time development. Ultimately I felt like my efforts weren't being rewarded or recognized and it was making me burn out. This, along with a management decision to not go remote during Covid-19 drove me to make the decision to quit.

I've since been working on learning the latest web technologies and occasionally working on my personal projects.

### Fun fact:
I'm from Austin, Texas (USA). My wife from a small town outside of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. And we met and live together in Tokyo, Japan. So we're a tri-cultural family.
